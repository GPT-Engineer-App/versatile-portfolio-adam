# versatile-portfolio-adam

create a portfolio website for Adam Shahin, a software engineer, that is very versatile and unique in its strucutre and design. This is for a software engineer, and it will have pop up displays for each project that has been created by Adam Shahin. It will also have a description about Adam Shahin somewhere on the portfolio page (where you think is best) about his passion for technology and software development. The projects you will include are:

* 		Cryptocurrency Price Trackerâ€¨
        * 		Created a program capable of tracking the prices of cryptocurrency updated in live time utilizing Python & PyQt6. The program UI was created using QT Designer.â€¨Created a program capable of tracking the prices of cryptocurrency updated in live time utilizing Python & PyQt6.

        * 		â€¢ Directed an advanced drone delivery simulation using State and Observer patterns to enhance realism by 30%.
        * 		â€¢ Enhanced both front-end and back-end development processes, achieving a 25% reduction in bug occurrence and a 20% improvement in UI responsiveness.
        * 		â€¢ Refined Agile project delivery with Jira, leading to a 40% boost in team productivity and a 15% reduction in release time.â€¨â€¨Handwritten Digit Detectorâ€¨â€¨â€¨â€¨
        * 		- Created a machine-learning model capable of identifying handwritten digits utilizing the open-source TensorFlow library and the MNIST dataset.
        * 		- The machine-learning model achieved an accuracy of 93 percent on average.â€¨		â€¨â€¨â€¨Publish Subscribe System (PubSub)
â€¨â€¨
        * 		- PubSub is a publish-subscribe system that allows clients to join, leave, subscribe, unsubscribe, publish and ping.
        * 		- The system is comprised of two components: the server and the client.
        * 		- The server is implemented using the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) library rpyc and manages a list of clients and articles.
        * 		- The client uses the rpyc library to connect to the server and allows the user to make requests.
        * 		- Articles are received by clients using a UDP socket and a receive thread is started to listen for incoming articles.â€¨â€¨â€¨Tetris Variantâ€¨â€¨
        * 		- Implemented an animated Python GUI program to play a variant of the classic video game Tetris using the turtle library.
        * 		- Utilized object-oriented programming concepts to create classes that encapsulate the game's data and behavior. 
        * 		- Customized the game's play area size and color, making the game adaptable to different screen sizes.	â€¨
